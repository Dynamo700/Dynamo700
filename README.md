<h1>Nick Quigley</h1>

Hello! My name is Nicholas Quigley. I graduated from the CNAâ€™s Accelerated Software Development program in January 2024. I enjoy learning more languages and frameworks to make myself a better and stronger developer.

<h2>ðŸ”¥ Skills and Experience</h2>

<h2>ðŸ’» CNA</h2>

During my first semester, I was introduced to the fundamentals of Python, Java, Javascript, and SQL. For our final projects of that semester, we created a blackjack game in Python and Java.

During the second semester, python, java, SQL and JavaScript were further expanded upon.

During the third semester, we were introduced to AWS, as well as emerging trends in the industry.

During the work term, I was selected by the Office of Applied Research and Innovation to be a Student Research Assistant. As a Student Research Assistant, I was given a project to work on. The project that I worked on was a react web application that used webGL to embed a game that I created in Maya into the website itself. In addition, I aided a fellow student in developing a web application that helped high school students determine what route would be best for them in the healthcare industry based on a variety of factors.

<h2>ðŸ”­ Since Graduating</h2>
 
-I have continued my education by learning new things such as Typescript, C#, and Zod

-I have begun to create a railway layout builder

-I have begun to explore mobile app development
